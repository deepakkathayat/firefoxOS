Jar Of Life - firefoxOS App

Jar of Life helps make your life productive. Add a task which you plan to execute, over some period of days. For each day that you do your task, say writing, or going to the gym, you get to fill the jar for that day. After a few days you'll start seeing the jar non-empty and filling. Just keep at it and the jar will keep brimming every day. You'll like seeing that jar fill, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not let the jar leak, which it will, if you skip a day. The emphasis is on NOT LETTING IT LEAK.
It works because it isn't the one-shot pushes that get us where we want to go, it is the consistent daily action that builds extraordinary outcomes.


You may have heard inch by inch anything's a cinch. Inch by inch does work if you can move an inch every day. Daily action builds habits. It gives you practice and will make you an expert in a short time.</p>
If you don't let it leak, you'll start to spot opportunities you otherwise wouldn't. Small improvements accumulate into large improvements rapidly because daily action provides compounding interest.

Don't let it leak!
